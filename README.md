# Hi, I'm Filip Mikina 👋

**Software Engineer | Infrastructure & DevOps Specialist**

I build distributed systems and infrastructure that handle massive scale—from real-time trading systems processing thousands messages per second to monitoring platforms ingesting 500k+ samples per second. My philosophy: the best code I've ever written is no code at all.

## 🛠️ Featured Projects

### [HyprDynamicMonitors](https://github.com/fiffeek/hyprdynamicmonitors)
The first power-aware monitor manager for Hyprland. An event-driven display configuration tool with interactive TUI, profile-based switching, and real-time power state monitoring. Think Autorandr+Arandr, but purpose-built for Hyprland.

## 🚀 What I Do

I specialize in:
- **Cloud-native infrastructure**: Kubernetes, Terraform, GCP, AWS
- **CI/CD optimization**: Reducing pipeline times from hours to minutes
- **Observability & monitoring**: Prometheus, Loki, Grafana at scale
- **Distributed systems**: Real-time trading platforms, microservices architecture
- **Infrastructure as Code**: Ansible, Terragrunt
- **Build systems**: Bazel, Pants, Buck, you name it
